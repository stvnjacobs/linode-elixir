# Linode

An [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) client for the [Linode API v4](https://developers.linode.com/v4/).

## Warning

This is stil very, very much a work in progress.
Changes in structure and methods will absolutely change.

I have a running list of thoughts and ideas in the [SCRATCH.md](SCRATCH.md) file.

## Installation

**The package is not yet [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish).**
Once it is, the package will be able to be installed by adding `linode` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [{:linode, "~> 0.1.0"}]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc) and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm).
Once published, the docs can be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/linode](https://hexdocs.pm/linode).
